# Sayulita #

Sayulita (SIGH-u-lita) is a starting point for CoronaSDK projects.

My hope is that it will grow into a base library of tools that make Corona development easier.

Sayulita is a small fishing village about 20 minutes north of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico where I have 
enjoyed many Coronas. :)
